# Chameleon - Oh-My-Posh Theme

Like many, I quickly got addicted to Oh-My-Posh after finding out about it (thanks Scott Hanselman!) but the main issue I found is that I wanted to use it EVERYWHERE. The result of this was that each of my shells had the same colour scheme and felt a bit "samey" instead of fun and unique.

### This theme was designed to be the single theme that can change colour based on your OS and also the shell you're using - hence the name!

Each OS colour scheme can be found and customized at the top of the theme. I started by using the official colour palettes of each OS, but unfortunately many were just too hard to read against a dark terminal window. In these cases, the colours have been bumped up in brightness by 10% or 20% to try and stay true to the original.



#### The console marker also changes dynamically!

| Linux          | $              |
| MacOS          | %              | 
| Windows        | >              |
| Error Code > 0 | error X        |
| Root           | Lightning Bolt |
